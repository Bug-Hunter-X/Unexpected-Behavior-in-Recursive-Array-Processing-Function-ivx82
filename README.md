This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: inadequate error handling when dealing with potentially heterogeneous data structures. The `bug.php` file contains a recursive function `processData` that processes an array.  It converts strings to uppercase and handles nested arrays recursively, but it fails when encountering non-string, non-array elements. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a more robust version of this function.
